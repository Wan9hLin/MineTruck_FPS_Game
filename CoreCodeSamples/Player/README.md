# Player System

**Focus:**  
Implements the core first-person player controller and combat-oriented ability framework.  
Handles movement, jumping, gravity, and locomotion feel, while coordinating skill usage such as grenades, bullet support, and air raids.

**Key Scripts:**  
- **PlayerController.cs** – Controls first-person movement, including walking, jumping, gravity, and ground detection; manages movement speed, silent walking, and footstep audio feedback.  
- **PlayerSkillController.cs** – Manages player skills (e.g., grenades, bullet support, air raids), including cooldowns, effects, and interactions with ammo pickups and skill upgrades.
