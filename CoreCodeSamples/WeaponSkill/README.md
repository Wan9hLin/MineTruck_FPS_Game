# Weapon & Skill System

**Focus:**  
Provides the core weapon-handling framework used during combat.  
Controls active weapon state, ammo tracking, and HUD updates to keep the player’s loadout clear and responsive.

**Key Scripts:**  
- **WeaponController.cs** – Manages weapon switching and ammo counts, ensures only one weapon is active at a time, and updates the UI with the current weapon’s status and remaining ammunition.
